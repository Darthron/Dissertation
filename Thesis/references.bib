abstract = "The Poisson process, a core object in modern probability, enjoys a richer theory than is sometimes appreciated. This volume develops the theory in the setting of a general abstract measure space, establishing basic results and properties as well as certain advanced topics in the stochastic analysis of the Poisson process. Also discussed are applications and related topics in stochastic geometry, including stationary point processes, the Boolean model, the Gilbert graph, stable allocations and hyperplane processes. Comprehensive, rigorous, and self-contained, this text is ideal for graduate courses or for self-study, with a substantial number of exercises for each chapter. Mathematical prerequisites, mainly a sound knowledge of measure-theoretic probability, are kept in the background, but are reviewed comprehensively in an appendix. The authors are well-known researchers in probability theory, especially stochastic geometry. Their approach is informed both by their research and by their extensive experience in teaching at undergraduate and graduate levels.",

abstract = {Predicting the occurrence of links is a fundamental problem in networks. In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing. Although this problem has been extensively studied, the challenge of how to effectively combine the information from the network structure with rich node and edge attribute data remains largely open.We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. We achieve this by using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph. We formulate a supervised learning task where the goal is to learn a function that assigns strengths to edges in the network such that a random walker is more likely to visit the nodes to which new links will be created in the future. We develop an efficient training algorithm to directly learn the edge strength estimation function.Our experiments on the Facebook social graph and large collaboration networks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches as well as approaches that are based on feature extraction.},

abstract="Representation learning for graph data has gained a lot of attention in recent years. However, state-of-the-art research is focused mostly on node embeddings, with little effort dedicated to the closely related task of computing subgraph embeddings. Subgraph embeddings have many applications, such as community detection, cascade prediction, and question answering. In this work, we propose a subgraph to subgraph proximity measure as a building block for a subgraph embedding framework. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach, SubRank, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several important data mining tasks.",
